- Then run ``cd ascii-audio``
- At this point you are going to want to find some audio and name it ``full.wav``

3. clicking on ``Tracks``
4. Clicking on ``Resample``
5. Setting to 4000
6. Exporting the audio as wav and set file name to ``full.wav`` and make sure the audio is signed 16 bit PCM

After that run
``python3 encode.py``
